Using TextField to control input with a system Keypad causes the sytem keypad to push from the bottom of the screen and obscures some
or all of the current data on the screen.
This app uses the UIKit library and UIViewRepresentable to Control input. More convoluted coding unfortunately but at least the system keypad is disabled.
